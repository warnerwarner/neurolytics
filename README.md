# neurolytics

Objects and functions to contain electrophysiological data, from both spikesorted and unsorted recordings

Contains two main types of objects, spiking and recording

Spiking objects - parent of both Threshold crossing and Cluster objects - contains information on spike times/amplitudes from one channel or cluster



Recording objects - information about a whole experimental recording --> Threshold_recording --> Unit_recording --> Binary_recording

Constructed from and saved as a series of npy files

Still work in progress
